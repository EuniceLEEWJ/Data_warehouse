**Overview**
The M-Stay project focuses on analyzing data related to a homestay and rental service, utilizing Power BI for data visualization and insights. The project aims to clean, process, and analyze booking data to derive meaningful conclusions about booking trends and service performance.

**Data Cleaning and Preparation**
The initial phase of the project involved extensive data cleaning. Duplicate entries were removed from both the Booking Table and Host Table, with 2 duplicate booking_id entries and 4 duplicate host_id entries eliminated, respectively 1. Additionally, invalid dates were identified and set to NULL, such as the erroneous host_since date of 16/05/9999 1. Negative values in the Listing Table were also addressed, with listing_price values updated to NULL and subsequently removed 1.

**Analysis Results**
The analysis revealed several key insights. Notably, April 2021 recorded the highest number of bookings at 140,515, while October had the lowest at 7,544 1. Medium-term bookings (30-90 nights) emerged as the most popular choice across all years, indicating a trend in customer preferences 1. Furthermore, the highest number of listings was noted during the summer of 2016, showcasing seasonal variations in availability 1.

**Conclusion**
The M-Stay project successfully cleaned and analyzed booking data, providing valuable insights into booking patterns and service performance. The findings can inform strategic decisions for enhancing service offerings and optimizing marketing efforts in the homestay and rental market 1.
